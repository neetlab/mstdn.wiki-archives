At the time of writing, there is no way to see an instance's user interface (UI) without creating an account. Users with accessibility needs have to create and then abandon accounts until they find a UI they can use.

This page is intended to be a user-maintained resource that allows people to see a UI without having to sign up. It should contain information that can't be found on the About pages that you can see without registering.

==Guidelines==

Please keep instances in alphabetical order, and use the following template:

<code><nowiki>=== Name of Instance ===</nowiki></code>

<code><nowiki>* '''URL of instance:''' https://thing.thing</nowiki></code><br>
<code><nowiki>* '''Default theme?''' Yes/No (If default, no need for screenshot)</nowiki></code><br>
<code><nowiki>* '''Default names and symbols for functions such as toot, boost, etc?''' Yes/No; save > florp, toot > ping...</nowiki></code><br>
<code><nowiki>* '''Brief description of main features of UI in words:''' Eg: black text on white background, different names or symbols for functions, etc.</nowiki></code><br>
<code><nowiki>* '''Date this wiki entry was last updated:''' Eg: 2017-04-30</nowiki></code><br>
<code><nowiki>[Optional; include only if not default] * '''Screenshot of instance in desktop browser, without user styles, showing Getting Started:'''</nowiki></code><br>
<code><nowiki>[[File:Screenshot.png|500px]]</nowiki></code>

Also:

* Feel free to update the out-of-date entries.
* If your instance's screenshot is small and you have a bigger resolution that can show more detail, feel free to update the entry for your instance with a larger screenshot.

===What to do===

# Check that your instance hasn't already been entered. To be extra-sure and save yourself some time, press <code>ctrl + F</code> to search the current page in your browser and type in your instance's URL. If your instance is on this list, it'll show up in this search. If your instance is listed but out of date, you can update it. If your instance is not yet listed, move onto the next step.
# Copy the above template text to your clipboard.
# Scroll down to the instance that comes before yours alphabetically, and click "Edit" on its header.
# Paste your template text into the bottom of the edit box.
# Edit the title (between the <nowiki>=</nowiki> symbols) and the first four sections, replacing the example text with your instance's information.
## If your instance runs the default theme as on [[#List of instances#Mastodon.social (flagship)|the Mastodon flagship instance]] you can delete the fifth bullet point (the screenshot one), and click save. You will probably be asked to prove that you are not a robot, which just involves checking a box to confirm that you are not, in fact, a robot. Your work here is done!
## If your instance has a custom theme, move onto the next step.
# Open ''[[Special:Upload]]'' in a new tab.
# Take a screenshot of your instance, with the "Getting Started" panel showing. You can click the star at the top left to put the Getting Started menu into the fourth column.
## It helps to crop your image to remove browser things like the address bar, and you could also blur out any personal information if you are so inclined.
# Upload it in your ''[[Special:Upload]]'' tab.
# Copy the filename from the top of the new image file page, which will say something like "File:Filename.png", and paste that into the last line of the template in your list-editing tab - leaving the opening <code><nowiki>[[</nowiki></code> and closing <code><nowiki>|500px]]</nowiki></code> in tact.
